## My Tools for Writing Papers
*Option One*

**Go For It**

My preferred method of writing essays is to just sit down and write. When I can focus and write, I can type a multiple page paper out in no time. I write the paper a few days ahead of time and then I go back later to revise, edit, or make the paper great again. If I need help making the paper great again, I ask for professional help.
